# hello-world
Just the demo of another repository

---------------------------------
Test Case:
---------------------------------
(Wiki)
a set of conditions under which a tester will determine
whether an application, software system or
one of its features is working
as it was originally established for it to do
(IEEE)
Set of test inputs, execution conditions and expected results
developed for a specific objective,
such as exercise a particular program path, or
to verify compliances with specific requirements

(additional note)
a instrument of planing for future testing,
it is a step by step process on how to test the application

(overall)
a test will pail or pass -
that's how a tester varify a requirement
AND there is AT LEAST 1 test case per requirement
A Test case does not contains OTHER test cases
Test Suite = collection of test cases

(difference)
some view test case as the smallest unit
with no more than one varification inside
AND that there must be 1 test case to 1 requirement
But there are are many negative test for every positive test

A test cases might validate one or MORE system requirements
AND generate PASS OR FAIL results

AND there can be other definations

BUT

"I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO ADDOPT YOUR DEFINATION USED BY YOUR TEAM"

---------------------------------
BUG REPORT (contains)
---------------------------------
1. short description of teh problem (expected vs observed)
2. step to reproduce the bug
3. status (assign TO WHOM): where is the bug in work flow
4. Serverty (assign by who)
5. Priority (assign by who)

Test Plan focus on conceptual nature of the test
-objective, schedule of resources

Some use as step to step guide

Q: What to Do when devloper cannot reproduce bug?
1. make sure if the bug is really fixed
2. Test the bug on other systems (2+ more)
3. make sure test is performed on the same environment / same build /
over all setting
4. Finally, ASK Developer to TEST ON YOUR ENVIRONMENT

Q: Feature vs BUG, what to do?
(donot need to be in sequence)
1. Check req doc
2. Check Manager
3. Ask end user

Q: HOW TO TEST XYZ?
1. ASK ABOUT REQUIREMENT / CONTEXT! What more can I learned about it?
Can I have another one?
2. START with POSITIVE testing (samll / safe/ or coverage first)
3. Then break things down
- Test with abnormal input from Positive test (boundary test)
- Test OUTSIDE of normal context, physical environment

EXTRA: at end of test session, stop,
collect data and provide feedback to enduser and developer

Q: what is use case?
A format (Used by business analyst) to specify system requirement -
usually, created from real life (in field) observation of end user at work.
- usually a comprehensive, complete business transaction.

Information collected Might be useful reference in End-to-End test

Q: When to stop test?
1. ALL the worst case senario are avoided
2. when number of bug is consistent regardless releases and time spend on test
3. Quality does not improve with
4. Decision made by Manager / User / the whole team of stakeholder

Q: IS bug fixed?
1. attempt to repoduce bug in steps described in bug report

Q: Bug Life-cycle
1. Found / identify
2. Reported / recorded step to reproduced
3. Bug is assigned to specific developer to fix
4. Fixed / pass re-test
5. Closed / feedback / record tracking

Q: SDLC
Conceptual Model used in Project Management
which describes
SW development process in stages
From initial fesibility study to maintanance,
Stages can be,
for example, analysis, design, documentation, testing, etc

Q: Describe A BUG
"MISMATCH": between req and actual sw behavior

Q: HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN 3-5 year?
What can they give?

Q: WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THIS CAREER /JOB?
Address that you -
have long term interest
have long term learning goal
tell a complete story

Q: When to automate
"Repetative" types of test / Regression test / Release acceptance test
- have to make sense cost-wise (time / money)
some test canot be simulated without automation
- simutaneous test OR chaos monkey (cost too high)

Q: What is test documentation?
   A business system that improves the process of software development
   test plan, module, cases can be optional for different context
   But bug report / library is usually included

Practice: ONE BUG PER BUG REPORT
1+ cause minscommunication, lose tracebility, project integrity

Q: When does "testing" begin?
QA begin from concept of requirement
Testing begin from first working code
- and after any change is made to code, test is needed

Q: Bug identify, now what?
1. need to be reproduceable on my system
2. then reproduce on other systems

Q: How do you do GUI test?

within the context of

The following checklist will ensure detailed GUI Testing.

Check all the GUI elements for size, position, width, length and
acceptance of characters or numbers. For instance, you must be able to
provide inputs to the input fields.
Check you can execute the intended functionality of the application
using the GUI
Check Error Messages are displayed correctly
Check for Clear demarcation of different sections on screen
Check Font used in application is readable
Check the alignment of the text is proper
Check the Color of the font and warning messages is aesthetically pleasing
Check that the images have good clarity
Check that the images are properly aligned
Check the positioning of GUI elements for different screen resolution.

F: good observer and learn from context
A: create pragmatic solution via ask for available help / material
B: solve problems with minimum prototype



what are your weakness?
 - This is ACTUALLY "How do you overcome the weakness?"

 - W: I used to take care of everything as a solo tester
      but eventually Too much work load because of my previous good
results from manual testing
      attracted more test request from different departments

 - A: trained our intern & utilize automation

 - R: maintaining high test coverage and utilize my time on extra
reuirested manual testing

(I used to take care of everything as a solo tester

(I discuss the situation with my manager, with his permission,
I trained our intern for some of the tasks as I process
& automate other tasks in parrell
- both are great way for me to learn the tools of testing
and re-learn basic features of our test environment and software
while maintaining high test coverage and utilize my time on more
important manual testing)
